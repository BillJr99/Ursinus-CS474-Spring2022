      questions:
        - "How does disabling notifications, or changing their color, on a mobile device break the motivation-trigger-ability (the Fogg model) cycle?"
        - "What elements (both qualitative and quantitative) might you measure if you were to observe usability?"
        - "How might a mockup allow one to create unit tests prior to implementing a software system?"
