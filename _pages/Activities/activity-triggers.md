      questions:
        - "Why do so many people use Google for searching, when more privacy-friendly solutions may exist?"
        - "Have you ever failed a CAPTCHA before?  What are its limitations for persons with disabilities?  Have you chosen to use one service versus another because of its use of CAPTCHA?"
        - "Notice that ReCAPTCHA uses two words instead of one.  Given what you may know about training algorithms for learning, how might ReCAPTCHA work?"

      title: "Psychological Triggers"
      questions:
        - "Why might video game companies feature ads of gameplay in which the player fails in a way that the viewer can easily identify?  What is the call to action or hook in this scenario?"       
        - "When do &quot;freemium&quot; applications tend to ask for microtransactions?  If the user declines, what might happen instead (hint - the user can typically continue playing for free anyway)?  Why is this a strategic choice?"   
        - "Imagine creating a new social network, and imagine that it is in some way better than your favorite existing social network.  Why might it fail in the market anyway, despite being an improvement?"        
        - "Imagine you observe a shopping application with a web-based shopping cart.  A user has had an item in their cart for over a day without checking out.  What are some external triggers that this application might employ to produce a call to action?  What other data might they utilize in the call to personalize the message?"
        - "What are some ways that your favorite social media program keeps you engaged for longer periods of time?"
