      title: Unconscious Bias
      questions:
        - "Can you think of examples of unconscious bias that are beneficial from an evolutionary perspective?"
        - "How might AI be trained to recognize certain groups of people, and what real-world consequences can you think of?"
        - "What can we do to mitigate our unconscious bias, given that we can't necessarily identify them all specifically?"
