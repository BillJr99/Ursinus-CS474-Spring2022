      questions:
        - "What makes the assembly in Norman Figure 4.1 so easy to put together without instructions?"
        - "What is different about the outlets of various amperages in the figure above?  Are their shapes different out of functional necessity?"
        - "Look up aviation design maneuvering speed (Va).  What does this speed represent?"
        - "Many vehicles only allow the rear-view camera to activate when the vehicle is in reverse.  This is an example of an interlock.  What is an interlock and why is this done?"
        - "Imagine a scenario in which a device automatically turns off unless a certain smart phone is within proximity of the device.  How might this work, what would be the benefit, and how might you indicate that the device is available or locked?"
        - "What are other examples of environmental constraints to facilitate correct user operation?"
        - "Can you identify examples where the addition of a constraint would improve the usability of a device?"
