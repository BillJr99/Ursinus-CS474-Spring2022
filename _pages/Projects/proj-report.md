Your final research report will center on a topic related to human-computer interaction.  Possible topics might include:

* Ethics in AI Algorithms (for example: facial recognition software, automatic classification systems)
* Accessibility Settings: Towards Ubiquitous Design - Normalizing Accessibility Features
* Wearable Computing
* Aging-in-Place
* Security and Privacy on the Internet-of-Things (for example: balancing privacy considerations with pandemic spread contact tracing, preserving autonomy while providing technology for aging-in-place)

For your given topic, research several recent papers related to the topic.  You can use the [ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction (SIGCHI)](https://dl.acm.org/sig/sigchi/publications) and [IEEEXplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) as a starting point to look for papers.  You will find prominent citations in the references for those papers, and these provide additional material that you should review.  

Your goal is to formulate a thesis around your topic, survey the literature and summarize the current state-of-the-art in your chosen space, and then synthesize what you've read into a cohesive message supporting your thesis.  You should conclude with "Future Work" in which you summarize your vision for the field.  In other words: what do these papers provide that is beneficial, and what do they leave open for someone to use this state-of-the-art as a springboard to build upon?

## First Draft (25 Points)

Prepare a first draft for feedback, which you will incorporate into your final report

## Paper Format

You should use LaTeX to format your report in academic journal format (you can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for this purpose).  Your report should include:

* An abstract
* An introduction section that details your paper's central thesis
* A background section motivating the importance of the problem you are investigating
* A section with subsections describing each of the papers you reviewed
* A section that synthesizes your findings around your paper's central thesis
* A conclusion section
* A bibliography of at least 5 academic references cited using BibTeX

Your paper should be formatted like these examples (note their sections and references):

* [A Multi-Disciplinary Framework for Continuous Biomedical Monitoring Using Low-Power Passive RFID-based Wireless Wearable Sensors](https://web.archive.org/web/20190719054014/http://shrenikvora.com/Shrenik_Vora_Smartsys.pdf)
* [Passive RFID-based Diaper Moisture Sensor](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10195509)
* [A Cyber-Infrastructure for SUpporting K-12 Engineering Education through Robotics](https://aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/2008/WS-08-02/WS08-02-013.pdf)

## Presentation

Prepare a 10-minute presentation summarizing your paper, which you will submit along with your report and present to the class.  Here are some example academic paper presentations to guide your design:

* [Fusion Learning on Multiple-Tag RFID Measurements for Respiratory Rate Monitoring](https://www.billmongan.com/publication/bibe2020)
* [An Adaptively Parameterized Algorithm Estimating Respiratory Rate from a Passive Wearable RFID Smart Garment](https://www.billmongan.com/publication/compsac2021)
